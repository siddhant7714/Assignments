    "- ***In object-oriented programming (OOP), abstraction is one of the fundamental principles that allows you to simplify complex systems by modeling them at a higher, more conceptual level while hiding the unnecessary implementation details. Abstraction is the process of focusing on the essential characteristics and behavior of an object or concept while ignoring the non-essential details.***\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Here's an explanation of abstraction with an example:***\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Example: Abstraction in a Car Class***\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Let's say you want to create a software representation of a car. In this context, abstraction would involve identifying the essential properties and behaviors of a car without getting into the minute details of how a car engine, transmission, or brakes work. You want to create a high-level representation that captures what's important about a car for your software application.***\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Abstraction in Action:***\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Identifying Essential Properties: Abstraction begins by identifying the key properties and behaviors of a car that are relevant to your application. These might include properties like the car's make, model, year, color, and behaviors like starting the engine, accelerating, braking, and turning.***\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Ignoring Implementation Details: Abstraction means you don't need to understand the intricate details of how an internal combustion engine works or how the transmission shifts gears. You abstract away from these details, focusing on what the car does rather than how it does it.***\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Creating a Car Class: In OOP, you can create a class called \"Car\" that encapsulates these essential properties and behaviors. For example:***\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Reusability: Abstraction promotes reusability. Once you've defined a \"Car\" class, you can create multiple car objects, each with its own make, model, and year, and perform actions on them without recreating the entire car concept from scratch.***\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***5. Real-World Example: Think of abstraction as using a TV remote. You know the essential buttons like power, volume, and channel, but you don't need to know the intricate electronics inside the TV. The remote abstracts the TV's functionality, allowing you to control it without understanding its internal details.***\n"

    "Encapsulation:\n",

    "Purpose: Encapsulation is a concept that focuses on bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, and it prevents the accidental modification of data.\n",

    "It ensures that an object's attributes are accessed and modified through well-defined methods.\n",

    "Example of Encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the \"Car\" class mentioned earlier. In encapsulation, you might declare the attributes (make, model, year, color) as private or protected within the class, meaning they can't be accessed directly from outside the class.
