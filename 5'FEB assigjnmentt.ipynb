    "Here's a brief explanation of each of the four pillars of OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation:\n",
    "Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit. In OOP, this unit is called a class. By bundling data and methods together, encapsulation provides several benefits such as data hiding, data protection, and improved modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Abstraction:\n",
    "Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts. In OOP, this is achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces. By defining abstract classes and interfaces, we can specify a set of behaviors that classes must implement, without specifying how those behaviors are implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inheritance:\n",
    "Inheritance is the process of creating new classes based on existing classes. In OOP, inheritance is used to create subclasses that inherit attributes and methods from their parent classes. This allows us to reuse code and create more specialized classes that add new functionality to the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Polymorphism:\n",
    "Polymorphism is the ability of objects of different classes to be treated as if they are objects of the same class. In OOP, this is achieved through the use of interfaces and inheritance. By defining common methods and behaviors in a superclass or interface, we can create a collection of objects that can be treated as if they are the same type, even though they are different. This allows for greater flexibility and modularity in code design."
